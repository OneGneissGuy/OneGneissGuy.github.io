My name is John Franco Saraceno. I'm a trained scientist and amateur maker with years of experience building hobby electronics and developing environmental sensors.

I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area and moved to the greater Sacramento area to attend college in 2004. I received a B.S. in Geology from U.C. Davis in 2006 and later a M.S. in Geology from Sacramento State. Upon graduation, I became a hydrologist with the [U.S. Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov) where I specialized in water quality sensor development for 12 years. In 2018 I began working in the Division of Environmental Services at the [California Department of Water Resources](https://water.ca.gov/) where I rebuilt the Quality Assurance Program.

My interests include environmental monitoring, drones, open source hardware and software projects, smart home automation and cellular IoT.
