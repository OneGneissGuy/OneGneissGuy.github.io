My name is John Franco Saraceno. I'm a trained scientist and amateur maker with years of experience building hobby electronics and developng environmental sensors.

I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area and moved up to Sacramento to attend college in 2005. I have a B.S. in Geology from U.C. Davis and a M.S. in Geology from Sacramento State. I was a hydrologist with the [U.S. Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov) where I specialized in water quality sensor development for 12 years. In 2018 I began working int he Quality Assurance Section at the Division of Enviromental Services with the [California Department of Water Resources] (https://www.cadwr.gov).

I love finding out how things work by tearing them down (and sometimes putting them back together again...). Recently, I've taken up developing low-cost wireless and Arduino based sensor platforms. I also develop open source data visualization and analysis packages in Python and Arduino projects and libraries. Check out some of my projects on [GitHub]({{ site.github.owner_url }}) if you would like to know more about them or contribute to make them better. 

When time (and weather) permits, I fly R/C planes and drones or work on hobby electronics projects. 

I also enjoy traveling and have had the opportunity to visit many great places as part of my career.
